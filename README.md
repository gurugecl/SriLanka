Sri Lanka Website

This is my website for people interested in visiting the island nation of Sri Lanka that I'm currently working on. The website seeks to entice people to travel to Sri Lanka as well as containing information about the country and links to help plan your trip.

The website has been expanded and now includes three different webpages. The original webpage is under the lankaIII files. The second page includes map and current weather information about the country. The code for that page is under the mapIII files which also includes a jquery library i downloaded for the weather data. The third page is under the transport files and also includes the review and translate code which will be added to it along with APIs for flight information and local transportation. The map page can be accessed on the original webpage by clicking on the map link at the top of the page and if you click on the home link on the map site you can be directed back to original site. The transport page can be accessed from either of the other two pages by clicking on the transportation link at the top.
