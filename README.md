Sri Lanka Website

    This is my website for people interested in visiting the island nation of Sri Lanka that I'm currently working on. The website seeks to entice people to travel to Sri Lanka as well as containing information about the country and links to help plan your trip.
    
    The pages of the website that I have created include the Home page, the Map page, and the Transportation page all which can be accessed by clicking on the links on the navigation bar at the top. The code for the Home page are within the navlanka files (html, css, javascript). This page containts numerous galleries and pictures to entice the traveller to visis Sri Lanka as well as links to other sites that give more information about places to visist, food to eat, and hotels to stay in.  
    
    The code for the Map page are within the navmap files and as well as the weatherlibrarymapIII.js file. This page contains maps as well as weather data and more detailed information about three of the main cities in Sri Lanka: Colombo, Kandy, and Galle. This page uses the Google Map API as well as one for weather and a travel widget providing detailed information on the three cities. 
    
    The final page I have created is the Transportation page and the code for it can be found under the navtransport files. This page also uses AngularJS extensively for a number of forms that I have created. The first part of the page contains a flight api that returns data for flights from a city of origin that a user types in to the capital city of Colombo. The second part of the page has a useful translate tool that gives users useful phrases and words in three of the main languages in the region by picking one of three languages: Sinhala, Tamil, or Arabic. Finally, the review section of the page lets users like or dislike the page as well as leave a detailed review of the site. 
    
    The rest of the links on my site take users to various other useful websites with information for planning a great trip to Sri Lanka
